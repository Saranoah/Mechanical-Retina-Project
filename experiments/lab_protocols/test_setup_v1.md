# Experimental Test Setup v1.0

## Objective
Test single-element mechanical photon detector prototype

## Equipment Required
- Laser source (405nm, 532nm, 650nm)
- Optical power meter
- Vibration isolation table
- Vacuum chamber (optional)
- Displacement measurement system (interferometer)
- Data acquisition system

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Setup
- Mount test device on vibration isolation platform
- Align laser source with mechanical detector
- Calibrate optical power measurement
- Establish baseline mechanical noise floor

### 2. Measurement Sequence
1. Measure thermal noise spectrum without illumination
2. Apply low-power laser illumination (1nW - 1μW)
3. Record mechanical response at each power level
4. Repeat for different wavelengths
5. Characterize response time and linearity

### 3. Data Analysis
- Calculate signal-to-noise ratio
- Determine minimum detectable power
- Characterize mechanical response function
- Compare with theoretical predictions

## Safety Notes
- Always use laser safety goggles
- Follow proper ESD precautions for MEMS devices
- Monitor vacuum chamber pressure if used
