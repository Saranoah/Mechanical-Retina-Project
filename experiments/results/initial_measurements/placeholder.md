# Initial Measurements Directory

This directory will contain:
- Raw measurement data files
- Analysis scripts and notebooks  
- Result plots and figures
- Experimental logs and notes

## Expected File Structure
- `/raw_data/` - Unprocessed measurement files
- `/processed/` - Cleaned and analyzed data
- `/figures/` - Generated plots and visualizations
- `/logs/` - Experimental session logs

*No experimental data collected yet - this is for future results.*
