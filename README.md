# Mechanical Retina Project

A revolutionary photon detection system using mechanical principles instead of semiconductor photodiodes.

## The Vision
Create a biologically-inspired retina that detects photons through physical displacement, radiation pressure, or photomechanical effects rather than electronic conversion.

## Current Status
🚧 **Theoretical Research Phase** - Proving feasibility through simulation

## Quick Start

# Run basic radiation pressure simulation
cd simulations/radiation_pressure
python single_photon_force.py

Approach
Phase 1: Theoretical feasibility & simulation

Phase 2: MEMS design & material selection

Phase 3: Prototype fabrication

Phase 4: System integration & testing

Contributing
We welcome physicists, MEMS engineers, optical engineers, and computational researchers.
